# @container-Queries-CSS

Container queries will be the single biggest change in web styling since CSS3, altering our perspective of what “responsive design” means.
No longer will the viewport and user agent be the only targets we have to create responsive layout and UI styles. With container queries, elements will be able to target their own parents and apply their own styles accordingly. This means that the same element that lives in the sidebar, body, or hero could look completely different based on its available size and dynamics.
